== DESCRIPTION:



== Requirements

* PUT THE REQUIREMENTS HERE
* MRI

== Install 0ptions

<%= project %>  can be installed using (a) the `gem install` command, (b) Bundler

=== (a) gem install

Open a terminal and type
$ gem install <%= project %>

.Upgrading your installation
[TIP]
====
If you have an earlier version of <%= project %> installed you can update it using:

$ gem update <%= project %>

If you install a new version of the gem using `gem install` instead of
gem update, you'll have multiple versions installed. If that's the
case, use the following gem command to remove the old versions:

$ gem cleanup <%= project %>
====
=== (b) Bundler

. Create a Gemfile in the root folder of your project (or the current directory)
. Add the `asciidoctor` gem to your Gemfile as follows:
+
[source]
----
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem '<%= project %>'
# or specify the version explicitly
# gem '<%= project %>', '0.0.5'
----

. Save the Gemfile
. Open a terminal and install the gem using:

 $ bundle

To upgrade the gem, specify the new version in the Gemfile and run `bundle` again.
Using `bundle update` is *not* recommended as it will also update other gems, which may not be the desired result.

== Usage

[source]
====

  <%= project.upcase %>.new
